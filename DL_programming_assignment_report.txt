You need to submit a report along with the assignment. The report should contain plots comparing the train/validation/test loss across different epochs for the following. 

1) varying the size of the hidden layer (50, 100, 200, 300) - [keeping just one hidden layer] You will have to draw the following plots

2) varying the size of the hidden layer (50, 100, 200, 300) - [with two hidden layers and the same size for each hidden layer] 

3) varying the size of the hidden layer (50, 100, 200, 300) - [with three hidden layers and the same size for each hidden layer] 

4) varying the size of the hidden layer (50, 100, 200, 300) - [with four hidden layers and the same size for each hidden layer] 

(for all the above cases you will use sigmoid activation, cross entropy loss, Adam, batch size 20 and tune the learning rate to get best results). For each of the 4 questions above you need to draw the following plots:

x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: training loss [4 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the four hidden sizes mentioned above]
x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: validation loss [4 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the four hidden sizes mentioned above]
x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: test loss [4 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the four hidden sizes mentioned above]
5) Adam, NAG, Momentum, GD [with 3 hidden layers and each layer having 300 neurons]

(again sigmoid activation, cross entropy loss, batch size 20 and tune the learning rate. momentum wherever applicable to get best results). You need to make the following plots:

x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: training loss [4 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the four optimization methods mentioned above]
x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: validation loss [4 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the four optimization methods mentioned above]
x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: test loss [4 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the four optimization methods mentioned above]
6) sigmoid v/s tanh activation [Adam, 2 hidden layers, 100 neurons in each layer, batch size 20, cross entropy loss]. You need to make the following plots:

x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: training loss [2 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the two activation functions mentioned above]
x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: validation loss [2 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the two activation functions mentioned above]
x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: test loss [2 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the two activation functions mentioned above]
7) cross entropy loss v/s squared error loss [Adam, 2 hidden layers, 100 neurons in each layer, batch size 20, sigmoid activation] You need to make the following plots:

x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: training loss [2 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the two loss functions mentioned above]
x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: validation loss [2 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the two loss functions mentioned above]
x-axis: number of epochs, y-axis: test loss [2 curves - each curve corresponding to one of the two loss functions mentioned above]
The deadline is extended to 13th Feb 1:00 p.m. IST.
